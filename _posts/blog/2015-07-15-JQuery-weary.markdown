Yesterday Aaron taught us some light Jquery using us as actors to illustrate firing an event and the resuting action. That all made sense.<!-- more -->

Today, however, we delved a little deeper and I'm completely lost.

In this pen I'm taking the gear menu from my GoodReads.com redesign and giving it a function. This one was easy enough to pull off.

In my GoodReads.com redesign I also wanted to save some real estate for some much needed white space. So I thought about having the books information populate on top of its image when you clicked it.

This was really easy to accomplish using code that I had created from the first codepen.

Lastly, I wanted to show on mouseover a yellow container div that was below an image of 5 star outlines. This is still a work in progress.
