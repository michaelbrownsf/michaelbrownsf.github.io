After spending what was a pretty restful weekend before demo days. I go to finesse my project with some feedback from Sam Kapila and somehow destroy one of my branches history, <!-- more -->leaving it three commits and pushes behind. Mind you my problem arises around 10:00 pm the night before we can no longer code our sites. So naturally...I have a complete meltdown.

Luckily Sam helped me straighten things out with enough time for 6 hours of sleep but enough time to also make somme of the changes that I needed to.


Sam rocks!
