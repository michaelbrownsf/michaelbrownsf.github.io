 Today is the first day at my new job and I realized I hadn't blogged since my Dad passed away on March 24th.<!-- more -->

His passing left me in a very dark place emotionally and the idea of coding or keeping up with my DailyUI submissions became more than I could bear.

Now that I have finally joined the work force again, creating landing pages for my employers dealers, I think I'm finally pulling out of my funk. The job is part time and I'm leanring Word Press which I didn't have much experience on but I HATE using tools to build code other than text editors.

I'm hoping to pick back up with DailyUI this week. I have a few dozen in the cue that need attention.
