Things are clicking better now. I am enjoying creating from mockups, which was always my forte anyway. All these divs and parent and child elements seems messy but I know that everything comes with time and the code will get better. 

I suffered a minor set back in class this week. After working on the homework for the weekend preceding, I didn't take many breaks and gave myself a DVT. I'm thinking that I will have to use this as my inspiration for my final project somehow. I can't be the only one this has happened to and finding a way to spread the word/keep even one more person from going through what I went through seems like something I should task myself with doing.
