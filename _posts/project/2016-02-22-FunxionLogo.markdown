Recently I decided to revive my old freelance business to make myself appear more professional to new clients. It all starts with a new logo.

I decided to use a technique we learned at the Iron Yard though I modified it slightly. I came up with a word list first. Then from that list I chose ten words that I felt described my business or my philosophy the best.

I then went to Sam's favorite thing in the world...Post It Notes!!!  I wrote my ten words on a post it leaving room for my doodle. Then I set a timer for 30 seconds and drew the first thing that came to mind when I read the word.

Here are 5 examples:

(/i/web.jpg "Web")
(/i/safe.jpg "Safe/Secure")
(/i/media.jpg "Media")
(/i/responsive.jpg "Responsive")
(/i/code.jpg "Code")

I then placed the post its on the desk in no particular order. Two images jumped out at me so I tried combining them into one image.

(/i/composite.jpg "Composite")

Then I took the composite into Illustrator to create the logo.
