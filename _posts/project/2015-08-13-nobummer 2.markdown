**This app is currently offline. **

This project was done as part of the Iron Yard's Hack-a-thon weekend and was our first chance to work as teams.

My team decided to go with a web app that gave you a checklist of things to do to make your summer fun and would keep track of your progress when you logged in.

We had lots of version control problems and merge conflicts. While our project was never finished, the final image in the carousel is what it would have looked like in the final version.
